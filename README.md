# ðŸ¤– Recommendations with IBM Watson Studio

This project focuses on building multiple recommendation systems using real user interaction data from the **IBM Watson Studio platform**. You will explore various recommendation techniques, evaluate their performance, and understand their strengths and use cases.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The notebook guides you through the process of implementing and evaluating multiple types of recommendation algorithms, aligned with the project **rubric requirements**. The dataset consists of user interactions (articles read) and will be used to predict which content is most relevant to a user.

## ðŸ“š Table of Contents

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   Understand the structure of the dataset, including user activity, article popularity, and data integrity.

2. **Rank-Based Recommendations**  
   Build a basic recommendation system that suggests the most popular articles.

3. **User-User Based Collaborative Filtering**  
   Implement a recommendation system that uses similarity between users to predict preferences.

4. **Content-Based Recommendations** (Optional/Extra)  
   Recommend articles based on metadata or content features (not required for project submission).

5. **Matrix Factorization**  
   Apply matrix decomposition techniques to uncover latent features for users and items.

6. **Conclusion and Extras**  
   Final analysis and wrap-up with suggestions for improvement and deployment considerations.
